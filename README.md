# Description
This repository contains code necessary to reproduce simulation results in "Causally-Interpretable Random-Effects Meta-Analysis." 

For data privacy reasons, we are unable to share code that exactly reproduces our data analysis. Nonetheless, the techniques applied
in our data analysis are broadly identical to those implemented in our simulation study. The small exception to this similarity
is described in Section 7.1 of the manuscript. Code relevant to that modification is included in `data_analysis_modification.R.`

We also include a script `estimator_comparison.R` that directly compares our method to that of [Dahabreh et al (2023)]{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/biom.13716}. This comparison emerged from
helpful feedback during the review process. The comparison is not referenced directly in our manuscript, but may be helpful to readers
who would like to better understand the two methods.
