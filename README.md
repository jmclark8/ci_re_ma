# Description
This repository contains code necessary to reproduce simulation results in "Causally-Interpretable Random-Effects Meta-Analysis". 

Please note that these scripts contain references to the supercomputing setup applicable to our home institution, which uses "Slurm" as its 
primary job submission and scheduling software. Aspects of our code that makes explicit reference to this computing setup will require
slight modification to be re-produced elsewhere.

We also include a script `estimator_comparison.R` that directly compares our method to that of Dahabreh et al. This comparison emerged from
helpful feedback during the review process. It is not referenced directly in our manuscript, but may be helpful to readers
who would like to better understand the two methods.
